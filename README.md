# Multiple Linear-regression

Overview : 
In this project I have built a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes

A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues.The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue.

Business Goal:
You are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.
